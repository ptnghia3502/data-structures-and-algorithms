## üìî Some of Facts
* Data Structures and Algorithms are 2 fundamental concepts in computer science that are crucial for solving problems efficiently and effectively.

* Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. A good data structure helps in reducing the complexity of an algorithm and improves the performance of a program.

* Algorithms are a set of rules or steps that are used to solve a problem or accomplish a task. They are designed to take inputs, process them, and produce an output. Efficient algorithms are important for solving complex problems, as they can significantly reduce the time and resources required to solve them.

* Data structures and algorithms are closely related as the choice of data structure can impact the performance of an algorithm. For example, an algorithm that requires frequent insertions or deletions may perform better with a linked list, while an algorithm that requires frequent searches may perform better with a binary search tree.
